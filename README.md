# RFP_Automation_Tool

While working at Walmart Media Group, I realized a majority of Account Management's time was being taking up responding to RFPs because the outdated excel template for ad agencies' internal systems called Prisma was incredibly manual. To combat this, I used my concurrently learned VBA skills to devise an automation template to make it easier to fill out the naming conventions. 

By using this template, it would not only save employees' valuable time doing a mundane task, but also ensure that naming conventions would be followed correctly in order to prevent mistakes such as mis-matched ads to targets down the line. 

On average, this tool saved Account Managers 4 hours per week.
